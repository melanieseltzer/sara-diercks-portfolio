> 🌎 The GIS portfolio of Sara Diercks

Live url: https://sara-diercks-portfolio.now.sh/

Showcasing projects from UCLA Extension's GIS and Geospatial Technology certificate program. It is currently under active development. Built using Next.js and powered by GraphCMS for the backend

## File Structure

Next.js uses a `pages` directory containing files that directly correspond to pages on the actual website (following a typical structure for SSR websites).

It is here that you would edit the content for each page. For example, if you need to edit content on the index page, you would edit `pages > index.js`.

The components themselves live in the `src` directory and follow a typical React component structure.

## Development 🚀
